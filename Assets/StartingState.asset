  storyText: "Brave Knight! Be not afraid of the sound of my voice, I am here to
    guide you on your perilous adventure through the Dragon's Den.\r\nHead my warning,
    you will be left with the choices of your path.\r\nWill you emerge from the den
    a Hero, or fall like many before you have...\r\n\r\nYou enter the dark cavern
    as quietly as you can with your heavy soon of armor, careful not to make a clank
    with your suit.  Your torch burns and lights up the room before you. You see
    two paths before you...\r\n\r\n1. Go Left (Press \rLeft Arrow)\n2. Go Right (Press
    Right Arrow)"
