  storyText: "The next chamber opens up to a dark room with torches along the wall.
    You see another two passages before you. Down the left you see a faint light,
    you can see that the passage gets smaller and smaller, probably still big enough
    to crawl through. Down the right you can hear voices, one male and one female.
    \r\n\r\n1.Go through the passage\r\n2. Follow the voices"
